### Introduction

A generic simulation of possible human viral transference, based on a variety of behavioural factors in combination with a chance of transference for each type of behavioural event.

The following factors currently contribute to the risk of transference:

* Density of people (UI controlled)
* RO max
* Number of contacts per person that can lead to possible interaction events [2-10]
* Number of possible contact events per day [UI controlled]
* Chance of transference by a location visited by an infected person [UI controlled] [chance of infection cleared after 1 day]
* Chance of transference by a contact event with an infected person [UI controlled]
* Capped percent of people meeting others at any given moment [UI controlled]
* Percent of people quarantined (non-spreaders, no social interaction) [UI controlled]
* Duration of infection [UI controlled]
* Perecnt of infection time spent in isolation [UI controlled]
